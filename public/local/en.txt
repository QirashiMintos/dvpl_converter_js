DVPL CONVERTER to NODE JS
- - Allows you to RECURSIVELY convert files to and from DVPL

Compatibility:
- - Platform: PC (64 bit/ 32 bit?)

Using:
- Download the latest version of the installer from "Release".
- Install the converter without changing the installation path. (I'll fix it soon)
- Use only in the FOLDER via the context menu.

Note:
- The converter only works recursively!
- Recursion is a programming term meaning a function calling itself. (The program processes all FOLDERS and SUBFOLDERS)
